            <img src="Images/hotsprings.jpg"></a>
            <p>The thermal waters of Hot Springs National Park have drawn visitors for centuries. Originally a site for American Indians to quarry novaculite, the area’s hot springs soon became a favored destination for those seeking health treatments. Now nicknamed “the American Spa,” the park preserves more than 20 miles of trails, 40 hot springs, and the historic Bathhouse Row – a stunning showcase of Gilded Age architecture. 

            Take a virtual tour of the park’s historic Bathhouse Row district in an interactive map – presented by the Midwest Archeological Center, the National Park Service, and the Southeast Archeological Center. View 360-degree photographs of the bathhouse interiors and learn about the importance of these 20th century buildings. </p>

            <p>Two-thirds of the island of St. John in the Virgin Islands is a national park. Virgin Islands National Park features gorgeous sandy beaches and palms, as well as a rich marine life in underwater coral reefs. But the park boasts more than just beautiful beaches – ancient petroglyphs, carved by the Taino Indians, can be spotted along the Reef Bay Trail, and plantation ruins tell the stories of when the sugar industry dominated life on the island. 

            Discover this park on a virtual tour of its historic windmills and plantations. Or take a virtual 3-D tour of the Annaberg Sugar Plantation, one of the finest remaining examples of the Danish Colonial Era industrial agriculture in the Virgin Islands. </p>

            <p>Formed by a volcanic eruption and collapse, Crater Lake National Park features the deepest lake in the U.S., and one of the top ten deepest lakes in the world. While people have inhabited the lake’s shores for centuries, the park was founded in 1902 to protect its natural resources, including its fresh, clear water, and cultural resources. 

            Go on a tour of the park with Dierks Bentley and park ranger Charlie in this 360-degree video produced by the National Park Foundation and the National Park Service.
