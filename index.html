            <h2>Information (Quarantine, COVID19, Pandemic)</h2>
            
            <p>Some information will be laid out here about the pandemic. This specific page will highlight some COVID19 information, while the other pages provide people with activities they can do from home while being quarantined.</p>
            
            <h2>COVID-19</h2>
            <p>COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.</p>
            
            <h2>How does it spread?</h2>
            <p>It is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.
            The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people. Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.</p>
            
            <h2>How to protect yourself</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.</li>
                <li>If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
                <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
                <li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.</li>
                <li>Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others.</li>
                <li>Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</li>
