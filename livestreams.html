            <p>Going outside is impossible at the moment (well not really, but its definitely not advised), but that doesnt mean you can't enjoy the outside scenery. There are multiple live streams of the outside world that run 24hours 7 days a week. Here are some examples.</p>
            
            <h2>Northern Lights</h2>

            <p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres.</p>
            
            <h2>Pipeline Cam</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DY5RYp4sxYc" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Welcome to the famous Banzai Pipeline, also known as Pipeline, on the north shore of Oahu at Ehukai Beach. Panning from left to right, this live cam provides the best visual surf report for one of the most popular surfing destinations in the world.</p>
            
            <h2>International Wolf Center North</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQfE_-sSdc4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>This camera overlooks a pack of wolves living at the International Wolf Center in northern Minnesota. The pack includes four ambassador wolves: Axel, Grayson, Denali, and Boltz. From the north side of the wolf enclosure you can watch as the wolves interact, eat, and travel through 1.25 acres, which includes two dens, a filtered pond and a forested area. Even in captivity wolves can be elusive so if you donâ€™t spot them right away, look closely in the background under the trees. Your patience will be rewarded.</p>
            
            <h2>Wolong Grove Panda</h2>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gm3bQVANtVo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>The Wolong Grove live cam at the Shenshuping Gengda Panda Center in China's Wolong Valley Nature Reserve provides views into 11 different panda yards. Watch as these giant pandas go about their day in this lush bamboo oasis.</p>
