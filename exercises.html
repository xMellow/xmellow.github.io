            Exercises
            </h2>
            
            <p>Being stuck at home isn't all about staying in bed eating chips and drinking sugary drinks all day. You don't need a gym or weights or machines to keep yourself healthy while quarantined. Here are a few exercises you can do at home without equipment.</p>
            
            <h3>Lunges</h3>
            <iframe src='https://gfycat.com/ifr/requiredthinabalone'></iframe>
    
            <p>Challenging your balance is an essential part of a well-rounded exercise routine. Lunges do just that, promoting functional movement, while also increasing strength in your legs and glutes.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms down at your sides.</li>
                <li>Take a step forward with your right leg and bend your right knee as you do so, stopping when your thigh is parallel to the ground. Ensure that your right knee doesn’t extend past your right foot.</li>
                <li>Push up off your right foot and return to the starting position. Repeat with your left leg. This is one rep.</li>
                <li>Complete 10 reps for 3 sets.</li>
            
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Pushups</h3>

            <p>Drop and give me 20! Pushups are one of the most basic yet effective bodyweight moves you can perform because of the number of muscles that are recruited to perform them.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start in a plank position. Your core should be tight, shoulders pulled down and back, and your neck neutral.</li>
                <li>Bend your elbows and begin to lower your body down to the floor. When your chest grazes it, extend your elbows and return to the start. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body during the movement.</li>
                <li>Complete 3 sets of as many reps as possible.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Squats</h3>
            <iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/uncommonwelcomeliger"></iframe>
            <p>Squats increase lower body and core strength, as well as flexibility in your lower back and hips. Because they engage some of the largest muscles in the body, they also pack a major punch in terms of calories burned.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by standing straight, with your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, and your arms at your sides.</li>
                <li>Brace your core and, keeping your chest and chin up, push your hips back and bend your knees as if you’re going to sit in a chair.</li>
                <li>Ensuring your knees don’t bow inward or outward, drop down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, bringing your arms out in front of you in a comfortable position. Pause for one second, then extend your legs and return to the starting position.</li>
                <li>Complete 3 sets of 20 reps.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Burpees</h3>
            <iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/frequentassuredannelid"></iframe>
            <p>An exercise we love to hate, burpees are a super effective whole-body move that provides great bang for your buck for cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by standing upright with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms down at your sides.</li>
                <li>With your hands out in front of you, start to squat down. When your hands reach the ground, pop your legs straight back into a pushup position.</li>
                <li>Do a pushup.</li>
                <li>Come back up to the starting pushup position and jump your feet up to your palms by hinging at the waist. Get your feet as close to your hands as you can get, landing them outside your hands if necessary.</li>
                <li>Stand up straight, bringing your arms above your head and jump.</li>
                <li>This is one rep. Complete 3 sets of 10 reps as a beginner.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Situps</h3>
            <iframe src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/allindelibleafricanbushviper"></iframe>
            <p>Although they get a bad rap as being too basic, situps are an effective way to target your abdominal muscles. If you have lower back problems, stick with a crunch, which requires just your upper back and shoulders to lift off the ground.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by lying on the ground on your back with your knees bent, feet flat, and your hands behind your head.</li>
                <li>Keeping your feet glued to the ground, begin to roll up from your head, engaging your core throughout. Don’t strain your neck during the upward motion.</li>
                <li>When your chest reaches your legs, begin the controlled phase back down to the starting position.</li>
                <li>Complete 3 sets of 15 reps as a beginner.</li>
            </ol>
