            <h2>New Skills</h2>
            <p>What better time to learn a new skill than now. Maybe you want to finally sharpen your Spanish or learn how to code, or maybe even learn some mechanic skills. Well the internet can teach you many things with a bit of patience and a lot of research. Below are some skills you can learn while at home.</p>
            
            <h3>Improve Speed Reading</h3>

            <p>How much more work could you accomplish if you were able to complete all of your required reading in one-third of the time? Or even half the time?

            Speed reading is basically learning to understand the fundamental principles of the human visual system, allowing you to eliminate inefficiencies in your reading and increase the speed at which you read while also improving your retention.</p>
            
            <h3>Learn Basic Car Repairs</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLOpo71JtIU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Car repairs can drain your wallet quickly, but there are a lot of repairs that you can actually do yourself if you take the time to learn new skills. Even if you don't have technical skills, you can still do things like changing your oil, fixing fuel filters, and changing alternators. This can help save you time and money. Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuxpxCCevIlF-k-K5YU8XPA"> channel </a>for more!</p>
            
            <h3>Learn Photoshop</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2EPIUyFJ4ag" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Everyone should know some Photoshop basics. Learning Photoshop is an important tool if you want to work in graphic or web design or even just use it at home for your own pictures. Because it is such a valued skill, it is great to be able to add to a resume as well.

            It is also important to learn Photoshop if you work in a hands-on marketing role. For example, if you create flyers, email newsletters, or brochures, knowing Photoshop will help you optimize your creations and retouch your images. Also while Adobe Photoshop is paid, there are free alternatives like <a href="https://www.gimp.org"> GIMP </a>which is available for Mac OS and Windows OS.</p>
            
            <h3>Learn To Cook</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJy1ajvMU1k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>While it is certainly one thing to be able to create a four-course meal at the last minute, it is another to be able to at least make a decent pasta dinner, a nice pot of soup, and a winning batch of chocolate chip cookies without the help from a box. Having the skill of cooking well will help you out for your entire life.

            First, you will be able to know what is going into your food and therefore what is going into your body. You can control how much fat and salt goes into your dishes to create a healthy diet for yourself and your family. Also, you can impress your friends and family when you have them over for dinner, even if you just make something simple.
            Lastly, you will save a lot of money eating at home versus eating at a restaurant. </p>
            
            <h3>Learn To Sew</h3>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nFoITRWJNPQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>Learning to sew, stitch, and patch is an excellent skill because it is as diverse as it is useful. While it's been typically considered feminine, there's nothing feminine about saving an expensive pair of pants from destruction.

            The short course above will teach you the basic skills of sewing, using sewing machines and even a few advanced techniques to set you toward the next level of sewing.</p>
